accuray pursuant to section 3.2 of the strategic alliance agreement providing, among other things, that distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the products and services ordered by such customer. 4.6. warranty. 4.6.1. scope of warranty. accuray will provide a warranty to each customer that the products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written specifications provided by accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following

      " § 240.24b-2, confidential information (indicated by {*****}) has been omitted from this document and has been filed separately with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to a confidential treatment application filed with the commission accuray incorporated multiple linac and multi-modality distributor agreement this multiple linac and multi-modality distributor agreement (\"agreement\") is entered into by and between accuray incorporated, a delaware corporation with its executive offices located at 1310 chesapeake terrace, sunnyvale, california 94089, usa (\"accuray\"), and siemens aktiengesellschaft, a corporation formed under the laws of the federal republic of germany, with its registered offices located at berlin and munich (\"siemens\"), as of june 8, 2010 (\"effective date\"). in order to achieve its business objectives, accuray relies on qualified distributors to market and distribute its products and services. accuray and siemens have entered into that certain strategic alliance agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the \"strategic alliance agreement\"), and such agreement provides that accuray and siemens shall enter into a distribution agreement for multiple linac and multi- modality purchases (as defined below). accuray wishes to appoint distributor (as defined below) as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor for the products and services to customer in connection with multiple linac or multi-modality purchases (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, and distributor wishes to accept such appointment. \"accuray regions\" means accuray's sales regions (as of the effective date) of the americas (north america and south america), apac (asia pacific, including australia and other than india and japan), eimea (europe, india, middle east, and africa), and japan. \"distributor\" means siemens, its affiliates, or any third party which has been granted distribution rights whose scope includes the products and/or services by siemens. \"multi-modality purchase\" means the purchase, on a single purchase order, of at least one distributor imaging product (e.g., ct, mr, pet-ct) and at least one system. \"product(s)\" means the system and/or related products manufactured by or for accuray for use in the radiosurgery market, which have been approved for sale in the customer's geographic region. \"quote\" means a quote provided by accuray to distributor pursuant to section 2.3 that will serve as the basis for the product configuration, services, pricing and delivery schedule offered to a customer by distributor. \"service(s)\" means the performance of radiosurgery-related service(s) by accuray or its distributors, which may include technical support, training or installation of products as specified in the quote. \"system(s)\" means the accuray cyberknife® robotic radiosurgery system or cyberknife® vsi™ system, as applicable. accuray hereby appoints distributor as a non-exclusive, worldwide distributor of products and services to customers solely in connection with multiple linac or multi-modality purchases, not to the exclusion of accuray itself or any of its other current or future distributors and subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. such price lists will be subject to change from time to time in accuray's sole discretion, and accuray shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide distributor with updated pricing on a regular basis, provided that pricing included in a quote delivered by accuray to distributor shall reflect accuray's current up-to-date pricing unless otherwise agreed. 2.2.2. notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, distributor may present for approval to accuray opportunities for sales of products and services at prices that differ from the prices set forth in the then current price list. accuray may, in its sole and absolute discretion, approve any such opportunity, and if approved in writing by accuray, distributor shall otherwise be permitted to pursue such opportunity at such prices, which opportunity shall otherwise be governed by and pursued pursuant to the terms of this agreement. distributor acknowledges and agrees that accuray will determine the appropriate quote process to be observed by the parties under this agreement and may amend this process (other than the approval rights set forth in section 2.3.2) as notified to the distributor reasonably in advance. in addition, distributor acknowledges that each proposed sale of a product or service under this agreement is subject to the approval rights of accuray set forth in section 2.3.2. accuray and distributor will comply with the following process for making sales of products and services in connection with multiple linac or multi-modality purchases: 2.3.1. opportunity. once distributor has identified a customer opportunity in connection with a multiple linac or multi-modality purchase, it shall request a quote from accuray based on the product configuration and services requested by the customer and the accuray region in which the customer is located, and shall include such other information regarding the customer and the proposed opportunity as accuray may reasonably request. following receipt of distributor's quote request, accuray will determine whether to approve the issuance of a quote related to such request. if accuray approves the issuance of a quote, accuray shall issue a quote to distributor based on the product configuration and services requested by the customer, including pricing for such products and services as provided in section 2.2 above. the quote issued by accuray in relation to a customer opportunity shall serve as the basis of any offer made by distributor to that customer and shall remain valid for at least six months (unless earlier declined by distributor), and distributor shall submit an amended quote request to accuray in the event adjustments to a quote are requested by the customer. to purchase products or services based on a quote provided by accuray, distributor will issue a purchase order, which shall include specific references to the quote number of such quote (the \"purchase order\"). accuray shall either accept or reject such purchase order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such purchase order in such period constituting disapproval. to the extent of any inconsistency between the quote and the related purchase order, the terms and conditions of such quote shall govern and distributor acknowledges and agrees that accuray shall not be bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a distributor purchase order submitted to accuray. the purchase order shall be delivered to accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address: accuray incorporated attn: contracts administration 1310 chesapeake terrace sunnyvale, ca 94089 main: (408) 716-4600 fax: (408) 789-4205 email: orders@accuray.com 2.3.4. cancellation; amendment; conflict. to the extent of any inconsistency between a quote or a purchase order and this agreement, this agreement shall prevail, unless such quote or purchase order is signed by both the cfo or general counsel of accuray and the cfo of distributor, expressly refers to this section 2.3.4, and states that the quote or purchase order is intended to supersede this agreement. distributor shall be and must at all times make it clear that it is an independent entity contracting with accuray, and is not the employee, representative or agent of accuray. distributor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to introduce, promote the sale of, and obtain orders for the products and services in connection with multiple linac or multi-modality purchases, including, without limitation, including the products and services in each of distributor's 4 oncology care systems price book and sales operation system, such that all of distributor's sales representatives can access quotations for products and services at least as easily as all other systems then available for purchase from distributor. moreover, distributor represents and warrants that, on the date hereof and during the term of this agreement and any extension thereof, it (i) possesses the knowledge, experience, skills, and ability required to properly fulfill its obligations under this agreement; and (ii) has the required facilities, manpower, capacity, financial strength, and knowledge to market and distribute accuray's products and services in connection with multiple linac or multi-modality purchases. during the term of this agreement and any extension thereof, distributor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to employ qualified sales and technical personnel familiar with the products and services, including, without limitation, at least one person in distributor's oncology care systems sales group with a primary responsibility for sales of products, to perform the marketing and sales requirements as set forth herein. distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its oncology care systems sales personnel with any sales duties related to the systems to attend any training provided by accuray in such personnel's accuray region pursuant to section 4.12. distributor shall inform accuray of all potential customers for multiple linac or multi-modality purchases during the term of this agreement or any extension thereof. distributor shall offer such potential customers only those products or services described in then current price lists, and only in accordance with the applicable customer quote and this agreement. for each sale completed by distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of products shall be between distributor and the customer and the service agreement, if any, shall be between accuray and the customer or accuray and the distributor, as determined pursuant to section 4.8. for each such sale, distributor must send a purchase order to accuray at least six (6) months prior to the expected shipment date. for the avoidance of doubt, (i) the obligations of the parties with respect to the service agreement are as set forth in sections 3.6 and 4.8 and (ii) the failure of distributor to sell a service agreement to any customer shall not be deemed to be a breach of this agreement. any product upgrades released by accuray (other than bug fixes and safety updates, which are addressed in section 4.6.3 and 4.6.4 respectively) can be purchased at the discretion of the distributor pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 2.3. such 5 upgrades will be available at the prices listed in the then current price list as of the date of the quote (unless prior written approval by accuray for application of an earlier price list is obtained) for the upgrade, less any applicable discounts as specified in exhibit a hereto. distributor has and will have during the term of this agreement and any extension thereof the ability to distribute, market and sell the products and services in accordance with the terms of this agreement, in full compliance with all governmental, regulatory and other requirements under any applicable law. distributor understands that, because it is distributing the products and services of accuray, a corporation subject to the laws of the united states of america, distributor must, when carrying out its duties pursuant to this agreement, avoid violations of certain of such laws. neither party (nor their sub-distributors, if any (\"sub-distributors\")) shall engage in any illegal activities. in the event a party deems that its good-will has been or may potentially be affected by any such illegal activity of the other party or the other party's sub-distributors, then such party reserves the right to terminate this agreement or any portion thereof that relates to or is materially affected by such illegal activity with no further liability to the other party or the other party's sub-distributors. distributor shall not be subject to any minimum purchase requirements, but shall agree to the annual sales targets set forth in schedule 2.5(d)(i)(2) of the strategic alliance agreement and to using its customary standard sales processes, including, without limitation, the mta process, with respect to sales of systems. siemens shall cause any of its affiliates or distributors purchasing systems or services pursuant to the terms of this agreement to agree to be bound by and comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement and the provisions of the strategic alliance agreement related to or applicable to such purchase, unless such affiliate or distributor is already party to a distribution agreement for products with accuray. accuray will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to distributor or customer, as applicable, in a timely manner those products and services required to fill confirmed purchase orders received from distributor in accordance with the terms of this agreement. distributor may request accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. if not feasible in accuray's reasonable judgment, then accuray shall promptly advise distributor of the reasons. if no such request is made, accuray shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the purchase order or via fedex ground, with no extra insurance. any supplementary shipping costs arising from the need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the purchase order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by accuray, if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such purchase order by distributor. for example, if a purchase order was submitted on june 1, with a requested delivery date of december 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by december 1 shall be borne by accuray, while if the requested delivery date was october 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by october 1 shall be borne by distributor. accuray will provide its then current u.s. list pricing for its products and services to siemens once per year during the term of this agreement and any extension thereof, or upon request from siemens. all prices will be stated in us dollars, unless another currency is agreed upon in writing by accuray. accuray will be responsible for and will bear all expenses related to obtaining and maintaining any approvals, permits and licenses required under any applicable law in order to sell, market and distribute the products and services to a customer in 7 connection with multiple linac or multi-modality purchases, including any upgrades to or expanded usage of the products; provided, however, that if accuray does not have a direct presence in or accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of systems specifically for the country in which the customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of products or services to such customer, accuray may require distributor (solely with the consent of distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with accuray pursuant to section 3.2 of the strategic alliance agreement providing, among other things, that distributor will be responsible for obtaining all such approvals, permits, and licenses for sales to such customer. distributor will provide any assistance or documentation reasonably requested by accuray and at accuray's expenses to assist accuray with its obligations under this section 4.4. accuray will be registered as the sole owner of any rights, title and interest to any of the products or spare parts, as the case may be; provided, however, that should any applicable law or regulation require that distributor alone be entitled to such ownership rights, distributor shall hold this approval as trustee for accuray and hereby consents to transfer or sublicense such approval to accuray free of charge or to support accuray in its efforts to re-obtain the approval for the benefit of accuray or a third party named by accuray upon expiration or termination of this agreement. lists indicating, as of the effective date, (i) the countries in which accuray has obtained regulatory approvals for the products and services and (ii) the countries in which accuray has a direct presence or has a distributor for the sales of systems specifically for such country are being delivered to siemens concurrently with the execution of this agreement. accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for all products and services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the united states, pursuant to this agreement; provided, however, that if accuray does not have a direct presence in or accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the sales of systems in the country in which the customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of products or services to such customer, accuray may require distributor (solely with the consent of distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with accuray pursuant to section 3.2 of the strategic alliance agreement providing, among other things, that distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the products and services ordered by such customer. accuray will provide a warranty to each customer that the products will be free from material defects and perform substantially in accordance with the written specifications provided by accuray as reflected in the regulatory clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following installation of the products at customer's facility, but not to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such products to distributor (\"warranty period\"). \"installation\" of the system shall occur upon completion by accuray or the entity installing the system, as applicable, of accuray's acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the system substantially conforms to the written specifications. if accuray does not perform the installation, distributor will notify accuray in writing within ten (10) days following installation (including any testing procedures undertaken by customer or its installation service provider). in no event shall distributor, customer or their respective agents use the system (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before installation thereof without the express written approval of accuray. except as set forth in the preceding sentences, accuray makes no warranties or representations to customers or to any other party regarding any products or services provided by accuray. if a customer notifies accuray in writing during the warranty period of a defect in a product that causes the product to fail to conform to the foregoing warranty, accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non- conforming product or, if in accuray's opinion such repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable, accuray shall refund a pro-rated portion of the price paid by the customer for such product calculated based on a straight-line depreciation over a 5-year period beginning on the date of delivery. notwithstanding section 4.6.2, for a period of 10 years following installation of a system, accuray will provide to customer, without charge, bug fixes with respect to any software included in the system. by way of clarification, accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such bug fixes available to customer, and accuray shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the customer and accuray) for installation or implementation of such bug fixes at the customer's site. notwithstanding section 4.6.2 and any obligations according to law, for a period of 10 years following installation of a system, accuray will provide to customer, without charge, safety updates with respect to any hardware or software included in the system. by way of clarification, accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such safety update available to customer, and accuray shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the customer and accuray) for installation or implementation of such safety update at the customer's site. the warranties set forth in this section 4.6 shall be void 9 and of no further effect in the event of abuse, accident, alteration, misuse or neglect of products, including but not limited to user modification of the operating environment specified by accuray and user modification of any software. unless otherwise agreed by accuray and distributor (including, without limitation, pursuant to the terms of any distribution agreement entered into pursuant to section 3.2 of the strategic alliance agreement), accuray shall be responsible for installation of accuray products at customer sites. accuray will provide its then current service agreements to distributor from time to time during the term of this agreement and any extension thereof, or upon request from distributor. all prices will be stated in us dollars, unless another currency is agreed upon in writing by accuray. such service agreements are to be offered to the customer on the terms as set forth in those agreements, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of accuray. accuray shall execute a service agreement with the customer upon receipt of (i) a copy of such service agreement executed by the customer, and (ii) any payments then due under such service agreement; provided, however, that accuray shall have no obligation to enter into such service agreement if it materially deviates from the form service agreement provided to distributor; provided, further, that if accuray does not have a direct presence in or accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of systems specifically for the country in which the customer requests services, as a condition to any sale of services to such customer, accuray may require distributor (solely with the consent of distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with accuray pursuant to section 3.2

order confirmed by accuray, accuray will provide such training in accordance with accuray's then current training offerings and will coordinate with the customer in order to provide such training at accuray's facility in sunnyvale, california (or such other facility as may be agreed upon by customer and accuray).\n"
